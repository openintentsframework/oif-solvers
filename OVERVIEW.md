# OIF Solver Overview

The OIF Solver is a high-performance cross-chain order execution system designed for the Open Intents Framework. It discovers intents across multiple EVM chains, validates and executes orders through optimal paths, and manages settlement processes. The solver operates as an autonomous service that monitors blockchain events, makes intelligent execution decisions, and ensures reliable transaction delivery across networks.

## High-Level Project Structure

The OIF Solver uses Rust for its performance-critical requirements in cross-chain transaction execution. Rust provides zero-cost abstractions for the modular architecture, compile-time guarantees for concurrent blockchain monitoring across multiple chains, and predictable latency without garbage collection pauses, essential when competing to execute orders. Additionally, the memory safety guarantees are crucial when handling cryptographic operations simultaneously.

```

## Conclusion

The event-driven architecture ensures responsive processing of intents, while the clear separation of concerns makes the system easy to understand and extend. Whether used as a complete solver or as individual components, the OIF Solver provides the building blocks for sophisticated cross-chain execution strategies.
