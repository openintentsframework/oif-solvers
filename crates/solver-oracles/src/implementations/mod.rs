//! Oracle implementation modules.
//!
//! This module contains concrete implementations of various price oracle
//! integrations. Each implementation provides price data from different
//! sources with varying levels of decentralization, accuracy, and latency.
//!
//! Implementations handle:
//! - Protocol-specific data fetching
//! - Price normalization and decimals
//! - Error handling and fallbacks
//! - Caching and rate limiting
